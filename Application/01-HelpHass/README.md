# Help Hass meet his friends

Hass has a problem. He has a meeting with his friends, but he's a little too late, so he'll have to travel by train. He knows the timetable of the transport, but there isn't enough time to calculate the fastest way possible.

Help Hass to decide which trains to pick!

* Every train travels 5 minutes from its first to its last stop.
* Hass is living near the stop H and he needs to arrive at stop L.
* There will always be a way to get to the destination.
